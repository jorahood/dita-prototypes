<title>Eclipse Content Provider</title>
<conbody>
<p>The Eclipse Content Provider was introduced in the DITA-OT Release
1.1. With the Eclipse        Content Provider, you do not need to
transform DITA files completely to HTML before loading them in Eclipse.
This new function will preprocess DITA files and dynamically transform
them into HTML at runtime.</p>
<p>During the building process, the Eclipse Content Provider generates
the file <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath>. The file <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath> provides
the definition of one or more tables of contents and locates the contents
to display.</p>
<p>Here is an example of creating an output for the Eclipse Content
Provider and view the output in specially designed Eclipse on Windows
XP. This assumes that your environment is already set up to run DITA-OT
transformations.<ol>
<li>Start the Windows command line interface.</li>
<li>Switch to the directory <b>c:\DITA-OT\</b> (or to your own install
directory for the toolkit).</li>
<li>Enter the following command to build:<codeblock>java -jar lib\dost.jar /i:samples/sequence.ditamap 
      /outdir:out /transtype:eclipsecontent </codeblock></li>
<li>Then view all        the files under <b>c:\DITA-OT\out\</b> and
copy these files to the        corresponding directory under the plugin
directory for Eclipse.</li>
<li>Call the specially designed Eclipse to view the output.</li>
</ol></p>
