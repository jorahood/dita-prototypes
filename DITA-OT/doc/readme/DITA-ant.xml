<title>Building DITA output with Ant</title>
<shortdesc>Ant is an open tool that the DITA Open Toolkit uses to
manage builds.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><title>Introduction to Ant</title><p>Ant is a Java-based,
open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation to declare a sequence
of build actions. It is well suited for development builds as well
as document builds. The "Full Easy Install" version of the toolkit
ships with a copy of Ant.</p><?Pub Caret -1?><p>DITA provides a set
of XSLT scripts for producing different types of        documentation,
such as help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, XHTML pages,
and PDF. The DITA-OT uses Ant to manage these scripts, as well as
to manage additional intermediate steps written in Java. </p><note>The
following instructions and the associated <i>build.xml</i> and   
    <i>ditatargets.xml </i> files are for the Java 1.5 (and above),
Ant 1.7.1, FOP 0.95, and Saxon-B 9.1 releases. These instructions
are likely to need        some adjustment for other versions of these
components and for specific        environments.</note></section>
