<title>Troubleshooting</title>
<shortdesc>This section is used for identifying problems when installing
     and executing the DITA Open Toolkit.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section>       <title>1. Out of Memory Error</title>       <p>In
some cases, you might receive a message stating the build has failed
due to an "Out of Memory" error. In many cases this can be solved
by switching from Xalan to Saxon as the default processor. Recent
versions of the "Full Easy Install" toolkit distribution ship with
Saxon instead of Xalan.</p><p>If that does not work, please follow
the steps below to fix this problem:</p><ol>
<li><p>For Windows, type <codeph>set ANT_OPTS=%ANT_OPTS% -Xmx256M</codeph> in
the command prompt before running a build. Alternatively, you can
add the value <codeph>-Xmx256M</codeph> to the <codeph>ANT_OPTS</codeph> environment
variable.</p><p>For Linux, type <codeph>export ANT_OPTS=${ANT_OPTS}
-Xmx256M</codeph> in the command prompt before running a build.</p> 
       </li>
<li>Run the transformation again.</li>

<section>         <title>2. java.io.IOException: Can't store Document</title> 
       <p>In some cases, when you run the JavaHelp transformation,
you might            receive the exception above. This problem is
caused by some HTML            files unrelated with the current JavaHelp
transformation were found            under the output directory. Please
follow the steps below to fix            this problem:</p>       
 <ol>
<li>Change into the output directory.</li>
<li>Clean the output directory.</li>
<li>Run the JavaHelp transformation again.</li>
</ol>     </section>
<section>         <title>3. Failed to load message file</title>  
      <p>In some situations, the toolkit may fails to load the message
file "messages.xml" and begin to throw exceptions.</p>         <p>To
fix this problem, you need to check if the files            'resource/messages.xml'
and 'resource/messages.dtd' exist in the toolkit. If not, please copy
them from the toolkit's            root directory.</p>     </section>
<section>       <title>4. Spaces in file names</title>       <p>Spaces
in file names will cause trouble during the processing because Ant
      use space as the delimiter when processing batch files in a
list. Please        prevent using spaces in the name of dita files.</p> 
   </section>
<section>       <title>5. Stack Overflow</title>       <p>Sometimes,
you will receive an error during the transformation which says   
   the stack memory overflows. Please follow the steps below to fix
the problem:</p>       <ol>
<li><p>For Windows, type <codeph>set ANT_OPTS=%ANT_OPTS% -Xms512M</codeph> 
          in the command prompt, you can also choose to add a new
opition            <codeph>-Xms512M</codeph> to the <codeph>ANT_OPTS</codeph> 
          environment variable.</p>           <p>For Linux, type <codeph>export
ANT_OPTS=${ANT_OPTS} -Xms512M</codeph>              in the command
prompt.</p>         </li>
<li>Run the transformation again.</li>
</ol>     </section>
