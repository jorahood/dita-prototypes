This document is a roadmap for the Darwin Information Typing Architecture: what it is and how it applies to technical documentation. It is also a product of the architecture, having been written entirely in XML and produced using the principles described here... </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="DITA-dsf.html">Specializing topic types in DITA</a></strong><br>
The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) provides a way for documentation authors and architects to create collections of typed topics that can be easily assembled into various delivery contexts. Topic specialization is the process by which authors and architects can define topic types, while maintaining compatibility with existing style sheets, transforms, and processes. The new topic types are defined as an extension, or delta, relative to an existing topic type, thereby reducing the work necessary to define and maintain the new type.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="DITA-domains.html">Specializing domains in DITA</a></strong><br>
In current approaches, DTDs are static. As a result, DTD designers try to cover every contingency and, when this effort fails, users have to force their information to fit existing types. DITA changes this situation by giving information architects and developers the power to extend a base DTD to cover their domains.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="DITA-mapdomains.html">How to define a formal information architecture with DITA map domains</a></strong><br>
The benefits of formal information typing are well known for the content of topics, but collections of topics also benefit from formal organizing structure. Such formal structures guide authors while they assemble collections of topics and ensure consistent large-scale patterns of information for the user. Using DITA map domains, a designer can define a formal information architecture that can be reused in many deliverables. </li>
