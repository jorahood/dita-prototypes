General notes:
* KB4 doesn't scale... down. Whenever we get a request from someone outside to buy our kb we don't have anything useful to give them because it is completely monolithic and not modular enough for anyone else to be able to start out by just editing some files and seeing them transformed. DITA can do that. That's where I think we need to start with KB5, to make the user interface be just editing files in folders. Whenever you need to do anything with KB5 you should just be able to go to a folder of files and edit the one you need to change. The backend's job will be making it easier to do DITA-style content reuse. E.g., finding a reusable component by metadata when you're not sure what its id or location is, making changes to a group of documents at one time, automating changes that are driven by changes by an editor (such as populating refbys from refs). But at its core the new kb should essentially consist of a folder of DITA files, the DITA OT, and some XSLT and CSS stylesheets. Then we can help everyone else in knowledge management that doesn't have the resources to develop a virtual kb interface or even to transform xml to html, and who may not need all the power that comes from having a CMS backending the file-based interface.
